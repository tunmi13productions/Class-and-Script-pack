#map3D, tunmi13
#A basic low-end map class for constructing 3D maps with an x, y and z axis, with x being left to right in length, y being back to front in width, and z being bottom to top in height.
#This class does not hold any sort of rawdata / parsing functions, or any additional sound or TTS functions. You are in control of that.
