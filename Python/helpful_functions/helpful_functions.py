#Helpful Functions, tunmi13 productions
#This script contains a lot of helpful functions I have created, mostly for myself, but I figured other people would have a use for them.
#As I continue to create more projects and require special functions, I will try to add them here in case others need them to.
#Enjoy.

def get_file(path,mode="rb"):
	"""Gets the file specified. Returns the file contents on success, or a blank string on error.
		Parameters:
			path (str): The path of the file, such as C:\test.txt.
			mode(str): The mode to read the file. Examples are rb and r. This is set to rb by default.
	"""

def write_file(path,contents,mode = "wb",overwrite = True):
	"""This writes to a file. If the path leads to a non-existing file, the file is created automatically. If the overwrite boolean is True, and the file is there, it returns False, since you specified that overwrite should be False, therefore acting like a check to see if the file exists.
		Parameters:
			path (str): The path to find the file. Again, if the file doesn't exist, it will be created.
			mode (str): The mode to write to the file. Example modes are w, wb, a, and ab. This is set to wb by default.
			overwrite (bool): A boolean specifying whether the file should be overwritten if it exists. If this is False, and the file exists, it returns False.

		Parameters:
			list (list): The list to be converted.
			delimiter (optional str): the element that should separate your list. Default is comma. NOTE: Spaces are not affected.

def list_to_linear(the_list):
	"""This converts a list into a linear format. Useful for making files that refer to a list and need to be converted into something the file can write. Returns a string containing the linear data on success, or a blank string on failure.
		Parameters:
			the_list (list): The list to be converted.

		Parameters:
			the_string (str): The string to be converted.
