# Class and Script pack

This archive contains scripts, classes, and useful functions that I've either created manually or obtained from open-source projects such as Lucia. There are both scripts from BGT and Python in this archive.

## BGT

Inside the BGT folder you will find all the classes and scripts relating to the BGT language. 

Keep in mind that I will no longer be working on these, since I have mostly moved onto Python, so the Python folder is where I'll be doing work and adding things.

## Python

Inside this folder is everything related to Python. I've been working on this section, and will continue to work on it in my spare time. If you notice anything wrong though, do not hesitate to contact me.

I've also began the process of implementing things from BGT into Python, in a folder called BGTToPython. The functions that people were familiar with when BGT was still alive are slowly being transferred into this script. So all you have to do is call 

```
import bgttopython
```

in your script, and you'll be set to do things like this.

```
bgttopython.wait(5)

bgttopython.directory_exists(path)
```

## Conclusion

I hope this helps people who are slowly moving over from BGT to Python, just like I am.

Thanks goes to the Lucia developers and contributors; [Lucia](https://github.com/luciasoftware/lucia) is partly used in this collection of scripts and classes.
