# Class and Script pack

This archive contains scripts, classes, and useful functions that I've either created manually or obtained from open-source projects such as [Lucia][lucia]. This now also contains my very own classes and scripts I have created using Sam Tupy's recently released [Non Visual Gaming Toolkit (NVGT)][nvgt].

## Python Folder
Inside this folder is everything related to [Python][py]. I will try to update and modify it in my spare time. If you notice anything wrong though, do not hesitate to contact me, open an issue, or submit a pull request.

## Brand New NVGT Folder
This repository now comes with an NVGT folder!

[Non Visual Gaming Toolkit (NVGT)][nvgt] is a brand new engine for creating audiogames with ease, developed by [Sam Tupy][samtupy]. It follows the concept of the Blastbay Gaming Toolkit (BGT) that was abandoned a long time ago, but is not derived from its sourcecode. It is brand new, open source, and is very flexible!

That being said, this folder contains classes and scripts specifically made for NVGT.

## Legacy
[NVGT][nvgt] contains a compatibility script that makes it significantly easier to port old BGT scripts into the new engine by utilizing old function names and properties, which hold their NVGT variants inside.

That being said, the classes and scripts that were in BGT can be ported into [NVGT][nvgt]. These can be found in the [legacy branch][old]. I would port these myself, but I don't have the patience as of right now, but feel free to port them yourself :).

I hope this helps people who are slowly moving over from BGT to [Python][py], BGT to [NVGT][nvgt], or even those who don't know where to start in terms of programming in general.
